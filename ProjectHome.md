Wheelly helps tracking your car expenses by providing easy way to enter daily usage counters and store them for future analysis. The goal is to build a full-fledged digital service record (DSR) implementation expanded beyond mobile devices.

In terms of pain elimination, Wheelly aims to reduce your paper work, while simultaneously satisfying curiosity for: what places were visited, amount of fuel burnt, distance ran, time spent in trips, and so on.



## What does Wheely do ##

  * Collects essential car usage data such as mileages and refuels
  * Calculates reasonable defaults of input values based on previous usage statistics
  * Synchronizes with GPS tracking and personal finance apps to collect relevant geolocation and fiscal data
